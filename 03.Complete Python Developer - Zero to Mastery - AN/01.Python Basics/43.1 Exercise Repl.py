# You are working for the school Principal. We have a database of school students:
school = {'Bobby','Tammy','Jammy','Sally','Danny'}

#during class, the teachers take attendance and compile it into a list. 
attendance_list = ['Jammy', 'Bobby', 'Danny', 'Sally']

#using what you learned about sets, create a piece of code that 
# the school principal can use to immediately find out who missed class so they can call the parents.
#  (Imagine if the list had 1000s of students. 
# The principal can use the lists generated by the teachers + 
# the school database to use python and make his/her job easier): Find the students that miss class!
