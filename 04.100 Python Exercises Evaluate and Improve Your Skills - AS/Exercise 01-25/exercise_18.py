# Exercise for reference: 

d = {"Name": "John", "Surname": "Smith"}

print(d["Smith"])

# Answer: 
# There is no key Smith  in the dictionary. Smith  is a value. You want to use Surname  if you want to access Smith :

# print(d["Surname"])

# Explanation: 
# A KeyError always means Python could not find a key with the name shown next to KeyError (e.g. Smith ).
