*** Encapsulation ***
the binding of data and functions that manipulate that data and we encapsulate into one big object so that we keep everything in this box that users or code or other machines can interact with in this data and functions are what we call attributes and methods right.


*** Abstraction ***
abstraction means hiding of information or abstracting away information and giving access to only what's necessary.So whatever the user or the programmer or the machine is interested in that's the only thing we give access to everything else.We kind of hide it in a blanket underneath the hood because our users don't have to worry about it.


*** Inheritance ***
Inheritance allows new objects to take on the properties of existing objects.
So you can inherit classes.


*** Polymorphism ***
In literal sense, Polymorphism means the ability to take various forms. In Python, Polymorphism allows us to define methods in the child class with the same name as defined in their parent class. As we know, a child class inherits all the methods from the parent class.
