# Question: Make a script that prints out numbers from 1 to 10

# Expected output:

# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10

# Answer:
for item in range(1,11):
    print(item)

# Explanation: 
# A for  loop is used to repeat an action (i.e. print ) until the iterating sequence (i.e. range ) is consumed. In our case it would print all items of the range one by one.
