#Question: Let's start with easy things first. What will the following code produce?

a = 2
a = 4
a = 6
print(a + a + a)



# Answer: 
# 18  

# Explanation: 
# The script would output 18  in the command line. Below is the explanation. 
# Since Python reads and executes scripts from top to bottom, variable a  will be updated in every line until line 3 where a  finally gets the value of 6 . Then the print  function prints out 6 + 6 + 6  which is 18 .
