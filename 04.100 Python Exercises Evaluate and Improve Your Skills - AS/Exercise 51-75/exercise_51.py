# Question: The code produces an error. Please understand the error and try to fix it

# print(type("Hey".replace("ey","i")[-1])

# Answer:
print(type("Hey".replace("ey","i")[-1]))

# Explanation:
# This code produces a SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing which means that Python found an unexpected End Of File while parsing. The reason of an unexpected end of file is there's a missing closing bracket at the end of the script. So, adding a closing bracket at the end of the file fixes the code.
