# Question: Please try to guess what is missing in the following code and add the missing part so that the code works fine.

# import math
# print(math.pow(2))

# Answer:
import math
print(math.pow(3,2))

# Explanation:
# You could pass any number there, so 3 is just an example. As the error suggested, you simply needed to pass a second argument so that pow  can calculate the power of the first argument.
# If you didn't understand the error, you could do help(math.pow)  to see how the method works.
