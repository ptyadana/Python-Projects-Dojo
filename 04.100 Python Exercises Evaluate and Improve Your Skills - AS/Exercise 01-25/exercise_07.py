# Question: List slicing is important in various data manipulation activities. Let's do a few more exercises on that.

# Please complete the script so that it prints out the first three items of list letters.

letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]

# Expected output: 
# ['a', 'b', 'c'] 


# Answer:
# print(letters[0:3])
print(letters[:3])

# Explanation: 
# [:3]  is just a shortcut [0:3] . Both would do the job so you can mark this exercise as solved if you the output was correct.
