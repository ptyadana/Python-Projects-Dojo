# Working From Home: A Guide to Success,/blog/working-from-home-guide-to-success,2020-03-16 21:59:56 UTC,"For years, it's become increasingly common for developers to get to work from home a few days a week or even full-time, as members of ""virtual"" teams. During the current novel coronavirus pandemic, many tech firms are adopting WFH policies to allow their staff to practice ""social distancing"", where people limit their contact to fewer people, to help reduce the spread the COVID-19 virus. Many of our readers may be at companies already doing this or will adopt this soon."
How To Get Good At Coding Challenges,/blog/how-to-get-good-at-coding-challenges,2020-03-04 21:47:44 UTC,"Learning to code is a lot like learning an instrument. Before you can play a song, you need to learn how to make the notes, then you can put the notes together to make a song. Before attempting whiteboarding challenges it's important to first learn the basic fundamentals. Regardless of the language you are learning you will need to master the following:"
Avoid Recruiters: Embrace Cold Email,/blog/avoid-recruiters-use-cold-email,2020-02-26 17:19:36 UTC,"Have you been excitedly sending out your polished post-bootcamp resume and cover letter, but are disappointed with the response rate? Maybe you have sent out over 100 applications but you have only received automated rejection emails? Unfortunately, this scenario is all too common, but it’s easily remedied by using the cold email strategy:"
4 Strategies for Whiteboarding Success,/blog/strategies-for-whiteboarding,2020-02-16 17:12:40 UTC,"So you've been practicing JavaScript for a while, and you're feeling confident in your problem solving skills. You land an interview, and you spend hours solving technical challenges. But when you get in the room with the interviewer, your confidence evaporates. You clam up, your nerves get the best of you, and you walk out of the interview feeling shaken."
8 Questions You Should Consider Before Becoming A Software Engineer,/blog/introduction-to-software-engineering,2020-02-13 20:07:09 UTC,"<span style=""font-size:14px"">Have you ever been curious if you have what it takes to become a software engineer? We recently launched a 6-part event series for women, to answer exactly that. Our lead instructor Alissa has been manning the helm of this initiative, and took some time to craft this blog post to identify the top 8 questions successful developers considered before learning to code: </span>"

Alumni Spotlight: Orlando Wong,/blog/alumni-spotlight-orlando-wong-rithm-school,2020-01-28 22:27:39 UTC,"Before joining us for Rithm’s 11th cohort, Orlando worked in research at the UCSF Cytogenetic Lab after getting his BS in Environmental Toxicology from UC Davis. He had the opportunity to use Python and R while working in the lab, which set off his interest in learning to code. Orlando decided to study Python and Java at CCSF, where he met his future cohort-mate Aaron and ended up joining Rithm School. Orlando took some time to discuss his student experience, job search, and advice he has for anyone looking to get into software engineering: "

It’s 2020: Where are the Women in Tech? ,/blog/it-is-2020-where-are-the-women-in-tech,2019-12-20 00:00:00 UTC,"2019 is coming to a close and our staff conversations at Rithm are taking on a more reflective quality: how did we do this year, both as an organization and as individuals? Where did we excel and, more importantly, where could we improve? From curriculum and culture, to the impact of our space and the overall student experience, everything is fair game. "
Implementation Intentions: The Secret Weapon to Achieve Your Goals,/blog/implementation-intentions,2019-12-12 00:00:00 UTC,"It’s that time of the year again, where everyone is making ambitious goals they will most likely never follow through with. You have probably read about how to set SMART goals and how writing your goals down makes you more likely to achieve them. I recommend both of those strategies, but don’t stop there. Do you set yearly goals? Do you achieve them? "

React Hooks! - An Introduction,/blog/react-hooks-intro,2019-10-22 00:00:00 UTC,"Hooks are here! At Rithm School we are constantly reviewing our curriculum and making sure that we are up to date on the latest technologies.  When we notice a new technology or technique rising in popularity (and also becoming a common question that interviewers ask), we have the ability to quickly incorporate it into what we are teaching."
An Introduction to GraphQL - Queries,/blog/an-introduction-to-graphql-queries,2019-10-15 00:00:00 UTC,"Welcome! If you're reading this, you have probably been told that GraphQL is one of, if not the best thing since the internet. Or maybe you've just been working with REST for so long that you think there's a better way. Regardless of where you're coming from, we'll be introducing what GraphQL is, how it acts as an alternative to REST, and how to get started with queries."
Alumni Spotlight: Sandy Cao,/blog/alumni-spotlight-sandy,2019-10-10 00:00:00 UTC,"With a background in fine art, proudly toting her senior superlative of “Most Artistic”, Sandy Cao didn’t consider herself the typical candidate for a coding bootcamp. She hadn’t worked a full-time job in nearly 3 years (as a business analyst at a fintech startup in New Jersey) before joining us as a student at Rithm School. However, during her time with that job, she taught herself SQL and the thrill of completing code stuck with her. Sandy took some time to discuss her job search, her experience at Rithm, and her wisdom for other women looking to break into the tech scene. "

Getting Acquainted With A Production Code Base,/blog/getting-up-to-speed-on-a-production-code-base,2019-06-18 00:00:00 UTC,"At Rithm School, company projects have started.  If you’re not familiar with company projects, it’s a three week portion of our curriculum where students work with instructors and outside companies on a real production code base. It can be a challenging time for both students and instructors as we’re all working together on problems and code that we’ve never seen before.  But the challenge is definitely worth while.  It’s a great tool for teaching good coding practices and how to work with a team.  By the end of the three weeks, the students have a lot more confidence that they can contribute to a production code base."

Debugging Like a Scientist,/blog/debugging-like-a-scientist,2019-04-29 00:00:00 UTC,"When you're first learning how to code, error messages can be intimidating. Because of this, beginners sometimes ignore error messages entirely. Instead, they will favor more of a ""guess-and-check"" approach to fixing bugs. While we don't encourage this approach at Rithm, we recognize that in the context of solving small, isolated problems, it can be successful. But when it comes to working on larger applications, professional engineers need a more sophisticated set of tools to fix problems."
